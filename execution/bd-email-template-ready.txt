Subject: Strategic Partnership — AurumFi: Gold-backed DeFi Solutions for [COMPANY_NAME] Clients

Dear [CONTACT_NAME],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm [YOUR_NAME], Head of Business Development at AurumFi, reaching out regarding a strategic partnership opportunity that could significantly enhance [COMPANY_NAME]'s digital asset offerings.

## About AurumFi
AurumFi is pioneering the next generation of gold-backed DeFi infrastructure. We've built a protocol that enables institutional clients to:
• Generate yield on gold-backed assets through our aUSD stablecoin
• Access DeFi liquidity while maintaining gold exposure  
• Provide clients with compliant, transparent digital gold solutions
• Integrate seamlessly with existing custody and trading systems

## Why This Matters for [COMPANY_NAME]
Your clients are increasingly seeking:
1. Non-USD denominated assets for portfolio diversification
2. Yield-generating opportunities beyond traditional fixed income
3. Compliant exposure to DeFi without direct protocol interaction
4. Gold-backed solutions that combine preservation with growth

## Our Unique Value Proposition
✓ Regulatory Clarity: Built on PAXG (Paxos Gold), providing clear regulatory framework
✓ Institutional Grade: Multi-signature governance, insurance coverage, 24/7 monitoring  
✓ White-label Ready: Customizable interface and branding for your clients
✓ Proven Security: Audited by Certik and ConsenSys Diligence

## Partnership Opportunities
We see several ways to collaborate:

### White-label Integration
• Custom-branded AurumFi interface for your clients
• Seamless integration with your existing systems
• Your branding, our technology and compliance

### Financial Terms (Preliminary)
• Setup Fee: Waived for strategic partners
• Revenue Share: 60/40 split (your favor) on management fees
• Minimum Commitment: $10M AUM within 6 months
• Technical Support: Dedicated integration team

I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss how AurumFi can help [COMPANY_NAME] capture the growing demand for digital gold solutions.

Are you available for a brief call next week? I'm flexible with timing and can accommodate your schedule.

I've attached our partnership deck and technical overview for your review.

Best regards,

Subject: Strategic Partnership — AurumFi: Gold-backed DeFi Solutions for Interactive Brokers Clients

Dear Interactive Brokers Partnership Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Alex Chen, Head of Business Development at AurumFi, reaching out regarding a strategic partnership opportunity that could significantly enhance Interactive Brokers' digital asset offerings for your global client base.

## About AurumFi
AurumFi is pioneering the next generation of gold-backed DeFi infrastructure. We've built a protocol that enables institutional clients to:
• Generate yield on gold-backed assets through our aUSD stablecoin
• Access DeFi liquidity while maintaining gold exposure  
• Provide clients with compliant, transparent digital gold solutions
• Integrate seamlessly with existing custody and trading systems

## Why This Matters for Interactive Brokers
Your sophisticated retail and institutional clients are increasingly seeking:
1. Non-USD denominated assets for portfolio diversification amid currency volatility
2. Yield-generating opportunities beyond traditional fixed income in this low-rate environment
3. Compliant exposure to DeFi without the complexity of direct protocol interaction
4. Gold-backed solutions that combine wealth preservation with growth potential

Given Interactive Brokers' leadership in providing advanced trading tools and global market access, AurumFi represents a natural extension of your digital asset capabilities.

## Our Unique Value Proposition
✓ Regulatory Clarity: Built on PAXG (Paxos Gold), providing clear regulatory framework
✓ Institutional Grade: Multi-signature governance, insurance coverage, 24/7 monitoring  
✓ White-label Ready: Customizable interface and branding for your clients
✓ Proven Security: Audited by Certik and ConsenSys Diligence
✓ Global Compatibility: Supports multiple jurisdictions and compliance frameworks

## Partnership Opportunities
We see several ways to collaborate that align with Interactive Brokers' client-first approach:

### White-label Integration
• Custom-branded AurumFi interface seamlessly integrated into IBKR platform
• Your existing client onboarding and KYC processes
• Unified reporting and portfolio management
• Your branding, our technology and compliance infrastructure

### Revenue Model
• Setup Fee: Waived for strategic partners like Interactive Brokers
• Revenue Share: 60/40 split (your favor) on management fees
• Minimum Commitment: $10M AUM within 6 months (easily achievable given your client base)
• Technical Support: Dedicated integration team and ongoing support

## Market Opportunity
The convergence of gold and DeFi represents a $12 trillion addressable market. With Interactive Brokers' 1.5M+ client accounts and $300B+ in client assets, even a small allocation to gold-backed DeFi could generate significant revenue.

I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss how AurumFi can help Interactive Brokers capture this emerging opportunity and provide your clients with innovative wealth preservation tools.

Are you available for a brief call next week? I'm flexible with timing and can accommodate different time zones given your global operations.

I've attached our partnership deck, technical overview, and regulatory compliance summary for your review.

Best regards,

Alex Chen
